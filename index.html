    <p id="text-area">Welcome to Lucky 7.!</p>

<p id="text-area">As you start the game, bidding value is fixed to 15 Lakhs,an initial sum of 90 Lakhs is provided.
 
To proceed, select one of the 3 options : “<7” , “=7” or “>7“ – which correspond to the sum of the numbers that would be rolled on the dice. Once you’ve made this choice, roll the dice. If your chosen option is correct, based on the numbers rolled on the dice, twice the bet amount would be added to your total, else, the bet amount would be deducted. Additionally, if you chose “=7” the amount added would be three times the bet amount, while the deduction on failure would be the same.
 
You have an option to choose insurance at any time during the game except at the start of the game when your sum is 90 Lakhs or at the end when your sum is 0.You can invoke the option of insurance by clicking insurnce button. If you choose to select insurance your loss will be compensated(no money will be removed in case of Loss) but a insurance premium will be removed from Your total amount at each roll , but if you win you get the winning amount minus the premium amount added to the total sum. You can take insurance by pressing the Insurance button.
Have Fun!
